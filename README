# Tokenizer - A Lexical Analyzer in C
Tokenizer is a simple lexical analyzer written in C. It analyzes the input file and generates two output files: output.txt and symbolTable.txt. 

The Tokenizer supports recognizing single-line and multi-line comments, common operators, common identifiers, decimals (without scientific notation), and integers.
### Usage
To use the Tokenizer, follow these steps:

1. Compile the program using the make command:

```
make
```

2. Run the Tokenizer by providing an input file:

```
./bin/main <filename>
```
Replace <filename> with the name of your input file. The Tokenizer will analyze the contents of the file and generate the output files output.txt and symbolTable.txt.

You can also directly use the ```make run``` command to process the "input.txt" file in the current directory (if it exists).

3. Clean up the directory by removing the generated files using the make clean command:
```
make clean
```
This command will remove the binary files.

### Notes
The file compiles successfully under clang version 17. If you are using gcc, you may need to modify the Makefile.
